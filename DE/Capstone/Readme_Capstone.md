2. World Temperature Data: This dataset came from Kaggle. 
3. U.S. City Demographic Data: This data comes from OpenSoft. 
4. Airport Code Table: This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities. 

## Data Model 

The purpose of the final data model is to provide easier access to immigration data. It can be used to answer immigration traffic coming during a particular any particular season. This can later be used to create a ML forecasting model to better manage the complete process.

1. airport_codes - Filtered for US as iso-country. Immmigration table can be joined with this table by pulling the iata_code to get the airport information
2. us_cities_demographics - Assumed static population
3. GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity - Assumed 8 years seasonality in temperature fluctuations
4. TourismByAirChannel 
5. Time - Time table created from arrival data in immigration data

## Steps:
Outline of the steps taken in the project.

1. All the files from ../../data/18-83510-I94-Data-2016/ are read. A custom function is written to parse the sas datasets to parquest files. These parquest are filtered for removing missing values and aggregated to improve performance
2. SAS numeric dates are converted to python dates and time related fields are extracted to create 'Time' table
3. From Global temperature, Seasons are added- spring, summer, autumn and winter.
4. US demographics data is loaded
5. Airport data is filtered for US, so that it can be joined with the corresponding i94 airports
6. Checks for joins are added in a separate function - Assumed 8 years seasonality in Temperature Fluctuations, Static Population in a city


## Scaling Scenarios
1. The data was increased by 100x. - Move to Cassandra as reading and and writing speed will become the top priority
2. The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7am everyday. - Move to airflow and create DAGs with triggers on failing pipelines
3. The database needed to be access by 100+ people. - Create a Data Lake with smaller analytical datasets which can be used to run business reports

## Quality Checks
A custom function is written that reads the parquet files and shows a sample of data loaded; checks for joins between the tables
